# ELECTRIC-CARS

A simple single-page web app built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**  
to browse electric cars, search/filter them, and mark favorites.

## Features
- View a list of electric cars loaded from a local `cars.json` file
- Search cars by name in real time
- Sort cars by different criteria (price, range, and others.)
- Mark and unmark favorites

## Tech Stack
- HTML for structure
- CSS for styling
-  JavaScript (fetch API, DOM manipulation)
- JSON file as local data source

## Project Requirements
This project satisfies:
- Single page app with no reloads
- Public JSON data (local `cars.json`)
- At least 3 event listeners (search input, sort dropdown, favorites button)
- Array iteration for rendering/filtering
- Clean, DRY code

## How to Run
1. Clone/download this folder.
2. Open `index.html` using **Live Server** (VS Code extension).
3. Browse cars, search, sort, and mark favorites.

## Future Improvements
- Add larger car images or details page
- Persist favorites with `localStorage`
- Add more filters (price range, battery size)
