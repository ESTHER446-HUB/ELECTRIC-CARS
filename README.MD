Electric Cars Web App

A simple JavaScript-based web application that displays a list of electric cars by fetching live data from a public API.
The project demonstrates the three pillars of JavaScript:

Handling Events

Manipulating the DOM

Communicating with a Server (using Fetch API)

This project also includes basic styling, error handling, and a clean user interface.
